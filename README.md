# 👨‍💻 About Me
I'm a software engineer from Italy.
- Passionate about computer science and .NET platform on which I have been working since my first work experience in 2020.
- Currently working from home 🏠 at [Hinto S.r.l](https://www.hintogroup.eu/it).

I just created this GitHub profile to keep track of some simple code examples, make in practice any interesting tutorials and experiment with some new things.

# :bug: About coding
Here you can find:
- <b>APIBaseTemplate</b>: Since I am often asked in interviews how I would organise a basic API for a generic database, <b>APIBaseTemplate</b> is a project that shows how I would structure a basic API project in .NET Core. It includes the database part, the ORM, the handling of services via dependency injection and everything else. All documented in the project itself.
- <b>SignalRSample</b> and <b>SignalRChat</b>: The first one It's just the SignalR implementation example from MSDN while the second one It's a little project based on the udemy course by Bhrugen Patel that I did to documents on this library.
- <b>Coding Challenges</b>: Here you can find some coding challenges taken from https://codingchallenges.fyi/.
